In order to run the client, perform the following steps:

If the binary is already made, then type in the ./client directory:
  1. sudo ./client.exe 192.168.1.xxx
    --> where "192.168.1.xxx" is the local IP of the server
    
If the binary is not included or you have made changes to client.c, then:
  1. cd /lib/libiec61850-1.1.1
  2. make
  3. cd ../..
  4. make
  5. sudo ./client.exe 192.168.1.xxx
